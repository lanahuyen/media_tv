# Media Streaming Platforms Analysis and Visualization Project

## Overview
In recent years, the media streaming industry has experienced exponential growth, reshaping how viewers consume content. This project aims to explore this evolving landscape by conducting a detailed analysis of streaming platforms, viewer behavior, content quality, and pricing trends. Using datasets from various sources including Netflix, IMDb, and historical pricing data, this project offers a comprehensive, narrative-driven exploration of the streaming market through an interactive web application. 

The web application, built using Flask, employs advanced data visualization libraries such as Plotly and Altair to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring key trends and insights in the media streaming domain.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- **Analyze** the evolving media consumption patterns, emphasizing the shift from traditional TV to streaming services.
- **Understand** how different demographics engage with streaming platforms, exploring factors such as subscription preferences and viewing habits.
- **Assess** content quality across streaming platforms using metrics like IMDb ratings and genre diversity.
- **Examine** pricing models and revenue trends across major streaming platforms.
- **Create** an interactive web application that allows users to explore these insights through engaging visualizations.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:
1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**: Gathering and preprocessing data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the datasets to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive visualizations to illustrate key findings and trends.
4. **Web Application Development**: Building a Flask-based web application to host the visualizations, enabling an interactive storytelling experience.
5. **Interactive Narrative**: A user-driven exploration of the data, guiding users through insights about the streaming industry.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Data Integration**: Merges data from multiple sources, including Netflix and IMDb, to provide a holistic view of the streaming landscape.
- **User-Driven Exploration**: Offers interactive elements such as dropdowns and dynamic charts, allowing users to explore data based on their interests.
- **Multi-Faceted Analysis**: Covers various aspects of streaming services including content quality, user demographics, subscription trends, and revenue analysis.
- **Comparative Insights**: Presents a narrative that contrasts streaming platforms with traditional TV, highlighting the market shift.

## Datasets
The project uses the following key datasets:
1. **`cleaned_NetflixTVShowsMovies.csv`**: Contains detailed information on Netflix TV shows and movies, including genres, IMDb scores, and platform-specific data. This dataset is used to analyze content quality and genre distribution.
2. **`cleaned_NetflixUserbase.csv`**: Provides insights into Netflix's user demographics, subscription types, and revenue. This dataset is essential for understanding user behavior and revenue patterns.
3. **`all_services_price_history.csv`**: Tracks the subscription price history of various streaming services over time, enabling an analysis of pricing trends and their impact on user behavior.
4. **`cleaned_IMDbMovies.csv`**: Includes comprehensive information on a wide range of movies, including genre and IMDb ratings, allowing for a cross-platform analysis of content quality.

## Data Processing and Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in this project. It involves handling missing values, normalizing formats (e.g., dates, text), and extracting relevant features. Key cleaning steps include:
- **Date Formatting**: Standardizing date formats across datasets, such as converting subscription start dates to a consistent format for duration calculation.
- **Genre Extraction**: Parsing genres into a standardized format to enable accurate analysis of genre distribution across platforms.
- **Data Normalization**: Converting column names to lowercase and removing extra spaces for uniformity.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputing or excluding missing values to ensure the integrity of analysis results.

## Data Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial EDA was conducted to understand the datasets' structures and identify key trends:
- **Genre Analysis**: Explored the diversity of genres available on different platforms and the popularity of each genre.
- **Subscription Trends**: Analyzed user subscription patterns and how they correlate with pricing and platform features.
- **Content Quality**: Assessed IMDb ratings across different platforms and genres to understand the quality and user reception of the content offered.

### Derived Metrics
- **Subscription Duration**: Calculated the duration of user subscriptions by computing the time between join dates and the last payment date.
- **Average Ratings**: Derived average IMDb ratings for various genres and platforms to identify content quality trends.
- **Revenue Metrics**: Summed monthly revenues to assess the financial performance of platforms across different regions.

## Visualizations
### Interactive Data Visualizations
The project employs Plotly and Altair to create a series of interactive visualizations, each serving a unique analytical purpose:
1. **Trends in Selected Genre Over Time**: An interactive Altair chart showcasing the evolution of specific genres over time, providing insights into shifting viewer preferences.
2. **IMDb Genre Distribution**: A Plotly bar chart illustrating the distribution of genres across the IMDb dataset, highlighting content diversity across platforms.
3. **Platform-Specific Analysis**: A suite of visualizations, including bar charts, that compare content quality (e.g., IMDb ratings) across different platforms.
4. **Subscription Type Distribution**: A pie chart showing the breakdown of subscription types, offering insights into user preferences for basic, standard, or premium plans.
5. **Revenue Analysis**: Bar charts depicting the total monthly revenue by country, revealing regional variations in streaming platform adoption.
6. **Subscription Price History**: A line chart tracking the historical price changes of various streaming services, providing context for market competition and pricing strategies.

## Web Application
The web application serves as the project's interactive front-end, enabling users to explore the data and insights dynamically. Built using Flask, the application comprises the following components:
- **Backend**: A Flask server that loads datasets, processes data, and serves visualizations through RESTful routes.
- **Frontend**: An HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface that dynamically displays visualizations based on user input.
- **Interactive Elements**: Dropdown menus, dynamic charts, and tooltips enhance user engagement, allowing for a tailored exploration of the streaming landscape.

### Flask Routes
- **`/`**: Main route that renders the homepage with various visualizations.
- **`/get-plot/interactive-genres`**: Serves an Altair chart visualizing genre trends over time, allowing users to interactively select genres of interest.
- **`/get-plot/imdb-genres`**: Provides a bar chart showing the distribution of genres based on the IMDb dataset.
- **`/get-plot/platform/<platform>`**: Generates a bar chart displaying IMDb ratings by genre for a user-selected platform.
- **`/get-plot/userbase`**: Displays a pie chart representing the distribution of subscription types across the user base.
- **`/get-plot/revenue`**: Produces a bar chart depicting the total monthly revenue by country, revealing key revenue drivers.
